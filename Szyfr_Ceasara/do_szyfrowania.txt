5. As my children have been sorting through their possessions, I have discovered most of their birthday presents from me have been put in the “For Oxfam” boxes. One son has discarded three items of clothing I gave him that still have their price tags. I asked him what was wrong with these floral shirts? He said the clue was in the title.
6. The rabbits still have no home to go to – I already miss them and we won’t be saying our goodbyes for weeks. Badger the cat, currently deemed too fat to fly, has not been taking his diet seriously, and I think is actually putting on weight with all the anxiety.

8. I am incredibly fond of Britain, tea, sarcasm, apologising, Andy Murray, Prince Philip, Greggs’ sausage rolls, Boots the chemist, Caitlin Moran, PMQs, irony, mad weather, the Edinburgh Festival,the BBC, John Lewis, real chips that aren’t called fries, scones that aren’t called biscuits that aren’t called cookies, and proper beer.
